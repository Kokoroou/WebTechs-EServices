        <p id="text">Studying abroad has two main benefits. Firstly, people who study abroad can
            get a better job when they return to their home country. This is because their
            qualifications and experience mean that they tend to get jobs that are higher paid, and
            they can also gain promotion quickly. Another advantage of studying abroad is the
            independence students can gain. For example, students have to cope with the challenges
            of living alone and meeting new people from different cultures. As a consequence,
            they will become more confident in their life and in their relationships with others.
            All in all, it is clear that studying abroad is a beneficial experience.</p>
